Business Challenge:

Walmart's management team seeks to gain deeper insights into customer purchasing behavior. Specifically, they want to analyze how factors like gender, age, and marital status influence purchase amounts. This analysis aims to inform data-driven business decisions.

Key Questions:

* Does spending differ between genders? Are there variations in average purchase amount between male and female customers?
* Does marital status influence spending habits? Do married or single customers tend to spend more overall?
* How does age impact purchase behavior? Are there spending trends across different age groups?
